The first dataset was downloaded from the UN Data repository.  The repository contained annual historical data for world development and other indices. For this study, ten years of millennium development goal target data were extracted using selected indices for the major economies in Western and Eastern Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, and Belgium) and Eastern Europe (Russia Federation, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, and the Czech Republic). The countries were selected based on the size of their economies and we believe the sample size is representative of the performance of this region and will be used as the sample statistical data for the regions. The data for this report was extracted as a CSV file, uploaded to the Power BI platform, and transformed in a way fit for analysis.
